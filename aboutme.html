<p>
Hello, I'm <strong>Teerapuwanai Chanachaisombud</strong>, but my friends call me Pause. I am currently a third-year student at Walailak University, majoring in Interactive Multimedia Animation and Game. I have a strong interest in <strong>Game Development</strong> and enjoy creating games that are both challenging and fun.
</p>
<p>
Through participating in programming competitions and Game Jams, I have developed skills in designing game systems, writing clean and efficient code, and collaborating effectively in a team. These experiences have also strengthened my ability to solve problems under time constraints, rapidly prototype game ideas, and understand the full workflow of game development.
</p>
<!-- <p>
I am passionate about turning ideas into playable games and continuously improving my skills to create engaging and enjoyable experiences for players.
